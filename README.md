# Weaving-Shell-Structures

##### Description

This project uses a non-linear, iterative strategies of subdivision (weaving by particles) for the design of a coherent formation/demonstrator/pavilion, focusing on its constructability as clarity and
coherence of geometry, detail and process. The computational approach is divided into a primary woven structure with their respective intersection points and the secondary structure following the same logic. The primary structure begins with the generation of a surface from which the particles are created and moved by using spin forces. The resulting nodes between the lines are evaluated to control the weaving distance. A list of elements are then created, to function as connections between the primary curves. The secondary structure emerges from equidistant points on the resulting primary curves. The following images explains visually the specific strategy.
